# Griddle, a Dice Game designed by Richard Garfield

Griddle is a light weight roll and write. The basic mechanics, filling a grid with cards and scoring the resulting poker hands, I have seen many times. I figure, in fact, there is a good chance this exact game has been made (though my scoring is likely different) - and I may have even seen it. If someone has a link to 'the same game with different scoring', please post it so I can credit accordingly.

Griddle
Make a 5x5 grid. Roll 2D6, decide which square to fill with the number you roll. If multiple people are playing, they each have their own grid and use the same rolls.

Scoring: After all 25 squares are filled each row, column, and the 2 main diagonals are scored using the following:
Pair: 1
2 Pair: 2
3 Kind: 3
Straight (all 5): 4
Full House: 5
4 Kind: 6
5 Kind: 10

2's and 12's are boosters, Enter them with a circle around them. They still count toward the above hands like normal, but, the rows/columns/diagonals they are in are multiplied by 2/3/4/5/6 for having 1/2/3/4/5 boosters. In other words, each one increases the multiplier by one.
